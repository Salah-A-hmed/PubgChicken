# PUBG Chicken - Restaurant Website

This project is a static, single-page website for a fast-food restaurant named "PUBG Chicken." It serves as a modern, responsive online menu and landing page. The site features a clean layout, a navigation bar, a menu section with high-quality images of food items, and a contact/footer area.

This is a front-end-only project built with pure HTML and CSS, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

## Features

  * **Responsive Navigation Bar**: A sticky header containing the restaurant's logo (`pubgLogo.png`) and links to different sections of the page (Home, Menu, Contact).
  * **Hero Section**: A large, full-width banner image (`pubg.jpg`) to welcome visitors.
  * **Menu Showcase**: A visually appealing grid layout displaying the restaurant's menu items. Each item has its own card with a name, description, and high-quality image.
  * **Contact & Footer**: A simple footer section with contact information and social media links.
  * **Static & Fast**: Built entirely with HTML and CSS, requiring no backend or build process to run.

  * Big Zinger
  * Super Zinger
